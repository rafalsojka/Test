Subject: Thanks for Attending the KPI Metric Tool Presentation

Hey Team,

Hope you're all doing well!

Just wanted to say a big thank you for joining the presentation yesterday about our new KPI metric tool. Your presence and input were super valuable.

As we discussed, this tool is here to help us collect test automation metrics more efficiently from your solutions. We believe it’s going to make a big difference in our testing and productivity.

We’ve attached the PowerPoint from the session for you to check out. If you have any questions or need more details, just let us know.

Thanks again for your time and contributions!

Best,
