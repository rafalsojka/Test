Certainly! When meeting with InfluxData customer representatives, it's important to gather information that will help you understand not only the cost but also the value and implications of using the on-premise version of InfluxDB. Here are some questions you might consider asking:

1. **Pricing Structure:**
   - Can you provide a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with the on-premise version of InfluxDB?
   - Are there any licensing models or tiers we should be aware of, and how do they affect the pricing?

2. **Additional Costs:**
   - What additional costs might we incur beyond the base price, such as support, maintenance, or updates?
   - Are there any hidden fees or costs related to scaling or additional features?

3. **Support and Maintenance:**
   - What kind of support packages are available, and how are they priced?
   - How frequently do you release updates or patches, and is there a cost associated with implementing them?

4. **Scalability and Performance:**
   - How does the cost change as we scale our usage up or down?
   - Are there performance limitations that might require additional investment to overcome?

5. **Customizations and Integrations:**
   - Is there an additional cost for customizing InfluxDB to fit our specific needs?
   - What are the costs associated with integrating InfluxDB with other systems or tools we currently use?

6. **Deployment and Training:**
   - Are there any costs associated with the initial deployment and configuration of the on-premise version?
   - Do you offer training or onboarding services, and what are the associated costs?

7. **Comparative Value:**
   - How does the cost of the on-premise version compare to your cloud-based offerings?
   - What are the long-term cost benefits of choosing the on-premise version over alternatives?

8. **Future Planning:**
   - How might future developments or features impact the cost structure?
   - Are there any planned changes to the pricing model that we should be aware of?

These questions will help you understand not only the financial aspects but also the overall value and practical implications of deploying InfluxDB on-premise.
