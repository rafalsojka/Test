Over the first half of 2024, Anna played a pivotal role as a developer and maintainer of a new Quality Management (QM) application, the KPI Metric Tool. This solution is designed to automate the previously manual process of collecting data on test progress across all projects led by the QM department. Anna consistently completed her tasks on time and to a high standard, demonstrating a professional attitude throughout. When challenges arose, she was always able to find effective solutions.

In addition to her development work, Anna served as the primary coordinator for onboarding QM projects into the KPI Metric Tool. This role required extensive collaboration with various QM teams, including test leaders and testers, and Anna excelled in this capacity, successfully resolving numerous issues along the way. Simultaneously, she served as the lead developer for the QTest module within the KPI Metric Tool, where she implemented, tested, and maintained the majority of the code, completing this task successfully as well.

Beyond her core responsibilities, Anna also actively participates in additional initiatives at BBH, such as Women in Technology and the Tatry Mountain Clean-up. She is a strong ambassador of BBH values, representing both the company and the QM department with professionalism.

Even as she transitions to a new team within the QM department, Anna continues to perform her duties with dedication and excellence. It has been a privilege to work with her on the same team.

Looking ahead to the second half of 2024, Anna will remain the primary developer and maintainer of the KPI Metric Tool, while gradually taking on new responsibilities associated with her role in the ITSS team.
