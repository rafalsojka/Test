Certainly! Here is a more professionally rephrased version of your message:

"Thank you, Christine/Nate, for your understanding. While we support this application and offer various customizations, it is technically our responsibility to enforce the standards, as we are the only group with the necessary permissions. Most teams adhere to these standards, but as in your case, Christine, some product owners or development leaders may have additional questions or requests regarding the standards. Therefore, we need someone who can support us from this perspective."
