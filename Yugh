Thank you for the opportunity to interview a candidate for the Infrastructure Application Support position on your team. During our interview, I noted that the candidate has extensive experience in various system administration roles, with a recent focus on Windows operating systems. Although he has some experience with Linux, his proficiency in Bash scripting appears to be between junior and regular levels. His Windows expertise is more advanced due to his current usage.

The candidate is seeking a new job to further develop his skills. His brief tenure of seven months with his current employer is attributed to a lack of growth opportunities. His English skills are adequate for the role.

In summary, while the candidate's knowledge is between junior and regular levels, his ambition and previous experience suggest he could be a good fit for the position, provided there is a probationary period of 3 to 6 months.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
