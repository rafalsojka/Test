Dear [Tester's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

We are reaching out to provide the metric report for last week's automation regression test suites, defect tracking, and manual tests for your projects. The report has been compiled and is now available for your review.

Please access the report via the following link: [Insert Link Here].

We kindly request that you verify the data contained in the report. As this data will be used to generate the QM monthly reports, its accuracy is of utmost importance. Should you identify any issues or discrepancies, please contact the QM Test Automation Team at your earliest convenience. Your feedback is essential to ensuring the precision and reliability of our metrics.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
[Your Position]

Thank you for your prompt response. We can cancel this request accordingly. However, please note that once the metric tool has been thoroughly tested, the Excel QM metrics spreadsheet will become obsolete. Therefore, all manual tests, automated tests, and defects, planned or executed in the coming months, must be tracked in qTest and/or Jira. Failing to do so will result in your work not being reported to higher management. 

Please ensure that all current projects not yet tracked by the QM KPI metric tool are reported through a proper request in the Jira project so we can onboard them to the tool promptly.

I will be out of the office from today until the end of next week. If you have any questions, please contact Anna.
