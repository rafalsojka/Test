Hi Vinayak,

Thank you for providing feedback on the first two candidates and arranging a meeting with the third one.

In our assessment, Ritika was the best candidate, responding confidently and clearly to most of our questions. However, since a work-from-home arrangement cannot be guaranteed on either end, we cannot move forward with her.

Comparing the other two candidates, Venkat and Abhilash, we believe Abhilash presented herself slightly better. We would like to continue discussions with her and propose hiring her at a regular level for a 3-month period to make a final decision.

Please let me know if this works for you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
