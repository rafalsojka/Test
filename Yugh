Thank you for your prompt response. We can cancel this request accordingly. However, please note that once the metric tool has been thoroughly tested, the Excel QM metrics spreadsheet will become obsolete. Therefore, all manual tests, automated tests, and defects, planned or executed in the coming months, must be tracked in qTest and/or Jira. Failing to do so will result in your work not being reported to higher management. 

Please ensure that all current projects not yet tracked by the QM KPI metric tool are reported through a proper request in the Jira project so we can onboard them to the tool promptly.

I will be out of the office from today until the end of next week. If you have any questions, please contact Anna.
