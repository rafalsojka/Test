"Leonid has consistently demonstrated exceptional performance as the Senior Performance Test Engineer throughout the first half of the year, meeting expectations across key areas. He has successfully completed his assigned projects within the designated timeframes and has been instrumental in assisting development teams to resolve performance issues in their applications.

This period was particularly challenging due to the loss of a team member, which significantly increased the workload. Leonid's professional attitude and proactive approach were crucial in managing this additional burden without adversely affecting the development projects.

Notable examples of Leonid's outstanding contributions include his work on Spectrum SP35, MS Dynamics 365, STAR, InfoFX, LINC, CustodyFX, and SmartAlerts/SmartCapture, among others.

In addition to his technical contributions, Leonid has been a valuable resource in supporting other team members, testers, and developers.

As we look forward, I encourage Leonid to continue his excellent work and to further enhance his technical skills in software performance testing. In the second half of the year, Leonid will lead a session on performance testing as part of the peer learning initiatives for the entire Systems department."
