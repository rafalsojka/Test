Certainly! Here's a more professional rephrasing:

"In Jira, we have already established a standardization process for software development projects that has been approved by the PMO, and Christine Bird can verify this. Therefore, the claim that Jira lacks standardization is inaccurate.

Additionally, I would like to address another point: standardizing processes does not mean eliminating the possibility of customization for systems, business, and infrastructure teams. In Jira, we have 3,541 active users across various departments, teams, and divisions, each with distinct requirements and processes. Whether we choose ServiceNow or another tool, it must offer the administration team sufficient flexibility to customize for these diverse needs. Failure to provide such flexibility could result in significant resistance during data migration to a new solution. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that any new solution supports not only general processes at a high level but also offers robust configuration and long-term maintenance options.

To illustrate the extensive usage of Jira within BBH, I am sharing some statistics with the entire working group:"
