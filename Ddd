Subject: Summary of GitHub Copilot Features in IntelliJ

Dear [Name],

I’d like to give you a quick overview of the key features available with GitHub Copilot in IntelliJ.

1. Inline Code Suggestions:
GitHub Copilot provides real-time, inline code completions as you type, helping you code faster and with more context.

2. Chat Option:
Within the chat feature, we have two modes enabled: Ask and Edit.

Ask Mode: You can ask natural language questions about your code or concepts.

Edit Mode: You can request changes—like refactoring—through natural language prompts.

Note: The Agent mode, which is more autonomous, is disabled by our security department due to strict banking security policies.

If you need further details or examples, feel free to reach out!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
