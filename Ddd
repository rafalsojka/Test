Dear Leadership Team,

As requested, I have reviewed whether Glowroot (our current open-source Application Performance Monitoring tool) can be replaced by Splunk, Checkmarx, Nexus, or our existing Prometheus setup. Below is a concise summary of the findings.

1. Splunk
Splunk is primarily a log aggregation and analytics platform. While it can ingest metrics and provide dashboards and alerting, it does not offer built-in code-level transaction tracing or detailed method profiling equivalent to Glowroot’s APM capabilities. Achieving similar functionality would require additional Splunk Observability components and increased licensing costs. Therefore, standard Splunk cannot serve as a direct replacement for Glowroot.

2. Checkmarx
Checkmarx is a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) solution focused on identifying security vulnerabilities in source code during development. It does not provide runtime monitoring, performance metrics, or transaction tracing. As such, it does not overlap functionally with Glowroot and cannot replace it.

3. Nexus (Sonatype Repository Manager)
Nexus is an artifact repository manager used to store and manage build dependencies and binaries. It has no application performance monitoring or runtime observability capabilities. Therefore, it cannot replace Glowroot.

4. Prometheus (Existing in our environment)
Prometheus is a metrics collection and alerting system. It effectively monitors infrastructure and application-level metrics such as CPU, memory, JVM statistics, latency, and error rates. However, it does not provide detailed per-transaction tracing, method-level profiling, or deep diagnostics for slow requests. While Prometheus can replace basic health and performance metrics, it cannot fully replace Glowroot’s APM functionality without adding a distributed tracing solution.

Conclusion
None of the reviewed tools can directly replace Glowroot’s core APM capabilities. Prometheus can cover system and application metrics, but detailed request tracing and code-level diagnostics would require an additional tracing solution if Glowroot were to be retired.

Please let me know if a follow-up discussion or alternative architecture proposal would be helpful.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
