w of our performance testing approach, tools, and strategies, and share practical insights from recent projects. The presentation will also address key questions such as:

What is performance testing and why is it critical for product quality?

When should performance testing be introduced in the development lifecycle?

What types of performance tests (load, stress, endurance, spike, etc.) should be applied in different scenarios?

How do we define realistic performance benchmarks and success criteria?

What are common performance bottlenecks and how can they be identified and resolved?

How can teams effectively collaborate to prevent performance issues early?

The session will include time for discussion and Q&A, providing an opportunity to clarify open points and exchange experiences.

We warmly invite you to join us to deepen your understanding of performance testing practices and explore how we can collectively improve system reliability, scalability, and overall product quality.

We look forward to your participation.
