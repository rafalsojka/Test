### GitHub Copilot License Management Process

To ensure the effective and compliant use of GitHub Copilot within our organization, we have established a structured process for managing licenses. This process aims to maximize the utility of licenses, promote skill development, and align usage with company policies.

---

#### **1. Formation of the GitHub Copilot Coordination Team**
- A dedicated team, referred to as the *GitHub Copilot Coordination Team* (GCCT), will oversee the management of licenses.
- Responsibilities include reviewing license requests, approving new users, monitoring usage, and ensuring compliance with policies.

---

#### **2. Eligibility and Onboarding Process**
- **Request Submission**: Employees interested in using GitHub Copilot must submit a formal request to the GCCT, expressing their willingness to utilize the tool effectively.
- **Training and Attestation**: Before receiving a license, candidates must:
  - Complete mandatory training on GitHub Copilot features, ethical considerations, and company-specific guidelines for its use.
  - Attest to their understanding and compliance with the companyâ€™s policies governing GitHub Copilot.
- **Approval**: Licenses are granted upon successful completion of training and attestation, subject to availability.

---

#### **3. Monthly Review Meetings**
- The GCCT will convene monthly to evaluate:
  - **Usage Reports**: An analysis of GitHub Copilot usage statistics for all current license holders.
  - **Compliance**: Adherence to the company's policies and guidelines.
  - **Non-Usage**: Identification of users who have not utilized the tool within the review period.

---

#### **4. License Revocation and Reassignment**
- **Revocation**: Licenses assigned to users who have not actively used GitHub Copilot during the review period will be revoked.
- **Reassignment**:
  - Revoked licenses will be reallocated to other employees who have expressed interest and meet the eligibility criteria.
  - Reassignment prioritizes those who have completed training and demonstrated a need for GitHub Copilot.

---

#### **5. Monitoring and Compliance**
- The GCCT will continuously monitor:
  - Usage patterns to ensure active and effective utilization of licenses.
  - Compliance with company policies to mitigate misuse and maximize productivity.
- Periodic feedback sessions may be held with users to gather insights and improve the overall process.

---

#### **6. Documentation and Reporting**
- Detailed records of training, attestations, usage statistics, license assignments, and GCCT decisions will be maintained.
- Monthly summary reports will be prepared to document the outcomes of the review meetings and identify trends or areas for improvement.

By following this process, our organization ensures that GitHub Copilot licenses are distributed equitably, used effectively, and aligned with business objectives and policies.
