AI Attestation Summary

Before deploying AI in the bank, ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and AML, align with internal policies, and obtain approvals from Compliance, Legal, and Risk teams. Verify data security, encryption, and access controls while ensuring model transparency, fairness, and bias mitigation. Implement continuous monitoring, risk management, and an audit trail to detect issues and maintain accountability. AI systems must be ethical, explainable, and support human decision-making rather than replacing it entirely.

AI Onboarding Summary

To onboard an AI system, start by defining objectives, engaging key stakeholders, and conducting a feasibility study. If using a vendor, assess their compliance and security credentials. Ensure seamless data integration, conduct rigorous testing for accuracy and security, and validate compliance with internal and external regulations. Deploy the system in a controlled manner with real-time monitoring, and provide training to employees on AI use, risks, and governance to ensure responsible adoption.
