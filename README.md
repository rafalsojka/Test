The "[JIRA] [DAR 2.0] Daily Data Protection" report includes only tickets that are in the "Data Masking" and "In Review" queues, as explicitly stated in the email below. It does not display tickets in the "DBA Assigned" status that are awaiting the DBA to click the "DBA Copying Completed" button.

In the case of DARII-2577, the delay was caused by Chona. This was not reflected in the "Data Protection" report because there was no prior request to include such cases. Therefore, the conclusion is that Chona was responsible for the delay in this instance.
