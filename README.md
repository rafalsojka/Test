Certainly! Here's a more professionally worded version of your message:


---

The Performance Testing Team conducts all load tests within the test regions—not only for Spectrum, but for all applications currently under development. For this reason, our load testing infrastructure is located in the test region rather than in the production environment.

Spectrum is the only application that requires authentication through a Citrix StoreFront server located in production, even though all Spectrum-related tests are ultimately executed in the Spectrum TEST/DEV region.

There is no business justification for migrating the entire performance testing environment from the test region to production.

Furthermore, our load servers in the test region have been specifically configured by the infrastructure team to support performance testing at scale. These servers feature high memory capacity, multiple CPUs, numerous IP addresses, and operate within isolated network segments to enable the simulation of large-scale load from varied IP sources. Migrating this setup to production would pose a significant risk and would compel us to run load tests from production networks, introducing additional risk factors. The complexity and risk associated with replicating this specialized infrastructure in production are considerable.

Therefore, if the Spectrum team is unable to fully migrate the Spectrum TEST/DEV infrastructure into the test region, we would prefer to proceed with a risk exception for this case—even if it requires Rick’s approval.

Please let me know if a meeting is needed to discuss this in more detail.
