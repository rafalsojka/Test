## **GitHub Copilot Attestation Process for Automation Testers**

### **Objective**
Ensure that all automation testers in the bank understand and comply with the restrictions on GitHub Copilot usage. These include its application exclusively for automated test scenarios, use only on test data, and prohibition of deploying Copilot-generated code in production systems.

### **1. Attestation Process Overview**
The attestation process involves the following stages:
1. **Training and Awareness**
2. **Policy Acknowledgment**
3. **Certification Quiz**
4. **Formal Attestation**
5. **Access Enablement**
6. **Periodic Review and Renewal**

### **2. Step-by-Step Process**

#### **Step 1: Training and Awareness**
- **Goal:** Provide users with detailed knowledge about GitHub Copilot and its permissible usage.
- **Actions:**
  - Organize mandatory training sessions (live or online) explaining:
    - What GitHub Copilot is and its capabilities.
    - Specific use-case restrictions: automated test scenarios and test data only.
    - Prohibited actions: deploying Copilot-generated code in production.
    - Potential compliance and security risks.
  - Provide a comprehensive **user guide** outlining usage policies, examples, and scenarios.

#### **Step 2: Policy Acknowledgment**
- **Goal:** Confirm that users have reviewed and understood the bank’s policy for Copilot usage.
- **Actions:**
  - Distribute a **GitHub Copilot Usage Policy Document** to all automation testers.
  - Require users to sign a **Policy Acknowledgment Form** electronically or physically.

#### **Step 3: Certification Quiz**
- **Goal:** Test users’ understanding of the policy and ensure they are aware of compliance requirements.
- **Actions:**
  - Develop a short quiz with questions such as:
    - What types of data can GitHub Copilot-generated code interact with?
    - Can Copilot-generated code be used in production systems?
    - What are the consequences of violating usage policies?
  - Set a passing score (e.g., 80%) and allow retakes if necessary.

#### **Step 4: Formal Attestation**
- **Goal:** Collect formal declarations from testers affirming their commitment to follow the policy.
- **Actions:**
  - Require testers to submit a signed **Attestation Agreement**, which includes:
    - A statement acknowledging they understand and agree to abide by the Copilot usage restrictions.
    - An agreement to report any misuse or policy violations immediately.
    - Confirmation that they will only use Copilot for creating automated test scenarios and working with test data.
  - Store signed attestations securely for audit purposes.

#### **Step 5: Access Enablement**
- **Goal:** Grant access to GitHub Copilot only to testers who complete the attestation process.
- **Actions:**
  - Verify completion of training, quiz, and attestation.
  - Maintain an access control list and provide access credentials or licenses only to eligible testers.
  - Integrate Copilot usage monitoring tools to ensure compliance.

#### **Step 6: Periodic Review and Renewal**
- **Goal:** Reassess and reinforce compliance regularly.
- **Actions:**
  - Require testers to renew their attestation annually.
  - Conduct refresher training sessions or update the usage policy if needed.
  - Perform regular audits to ensure compliance with the policy.

---

### **3. Compliance Enforcement**
- **Monitoring:** Use tools to track Copilot usage and ensure compliance (e.g., log analysis, activity tracking).
- **Incident Management:** Define a clear process for reporting and addressing policy violations.
- **Consequences:** Outline disciplinary actions for non-compliance, ranging from warnings to access revocation or other penalties.

---

### **4. Benefits of This Process**
- Ensures testers understand and adhere to the policy.
- Mitigates compliance and security risks.
- Demonstrates regulatory alignment and due diligence in using AI tools.
