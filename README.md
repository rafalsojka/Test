Subject: GitHub Copilot Training & Attestation Process for Automation Testers

Dear QM Leadership,

I would like to extend my thanks to all of you for providing the list of automation testers eligible for GitHub Copilot last month.

Starting next week, we will begin scheduling mandatory training for this group and setting up an attestation process to ensure they understand the usage limitations of GitHub Copilot within .

This training and attestation will serve as a preliminary step before assigning GitHub Copilot licenses to their profiles. However, over the past few days, some test leaders have requested the opportunity to review and potentially update the list of automation testers before we proceed with scheduling. To facilitate this, I am sharing the current list of testers entitled to a GitHub Copilot license.

If any updates are needed on your end, please review the list and provide any revisions by the end of the day on Wednesday, February 26.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
