**QM KPI Metric Tool** is a Java-based application designed to collect, store, and visualize key quality management metrics across multiple testing platforms. The tool integrates with various systems to provide a comprehensive view of test execution and defect tracking:  

- **Manual Test Execution**: Data is retrieved from **qTest Manager**, offering insights into manual testing efforts.  
- **Defect Tracking**: Defects can be tracked in **qTest Manager and/or JIRA**, depending on the preferences of the test and development teams.  
- **Automated Test Execution**: Metrics are collected through **test automation listeners**, supporting widely used programming languages and frameworks such as **Java/TestNG, Java/JUnit, Cucumber**, and others.  

All collected data is stored in **InfluxDB**, ensuring efficient time-series data management. Reports and visualizations are then generated using **Grafana**, enabling teams to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as test coverage, defect trends, and automation efficiency. By providing real-time insights, the **QM KPI Metric Tool** supports data-driven decision-making and continuous quality improvement.
