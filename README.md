System Performance (Pressure) Testing Approach

As part of agd’s technology best practices, systems are designed and implemented to scale both horizontally and vertically to accommodate at least three times (3x) the anticipated peak load. Performance and load testing, often referred to as pressure testing, is integrated into our secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all new application implementations and for subsequent changes to existing applications.

Frequency:
Performance testing is conducted:

Prior to the initial production deployment of new applications,

During significant application upgrades or infrastructure changes,

As needed based on changes to expected system usage or architecture.


Key Steps Involved:

Requirement Analysis: Define expected load profiles and performance requirements.

Environment Preparation: Configure test environments to closely replicate production settings.

Test Design: Create performance test scenarios based on anticipated usage patterns.

Test Execution: Execute load, stress, and scalability tests to validate system behavior under normal and peak conditions.

Monitoring and Analysis: Measure system response times, throughput, resource utilization, and bottlenecks during testing.

Reporting: Document results, identify performance issues, and recommend optimizations.

Re-testing: Re-execute tests following any identified optimizations or changes.


Policies and Standards:
agd maintains rigorous standards for testing, including performance testing, as governed by our Systems Quality Management practice guide. Testing standards ensure that systems meet predefined performance benchmarks before deployment and that risks related to system scalability and stability are proactively addressed.
