### **GitHub Copilot Onboarding Process**  

To ensure a structured and compliant rollout of GitHub Copilot within our organization, we have established a **five-phase onboarding process**. This approach ensures that all users are properly trained, attest to their understanding of usage guidelines, and have their access managed efficiently.  

#### **1. Process Definition (Completed – January & February)**  
During this phase, we established the governance framework for GitHub Copilot usage in our organization. This included defining **usage policies, compliance requirements, and security considerations** to align with industry regulations and internal guidelines.  

#### **2. Training & Awareness (In Progress – February/March)**  
This phase focuses on educating testers on the **capabilities, limitations, and compliance aspects** of GitHub Copilot. This meeting is part of the training initiative, ensuring that all users understand **how to use Copilot responsibly and effectively in test automation**.  

#### **3. Formal Attestation (Initiated Next Week – March)**  
Following this training, all testers will be required to **acknowledge their understanding** of the GitHub Copilot usage policies. Next week, each of you will receive an **attestation task** via the AI Office Attestation Page. Completion of this step is **mandatory before access can be granted**.  

#### **4. Access Enablement (March & April)**  
Copilot licenses will be assigned in **two waves**:  
- **Group 1:** Access will be granted in **March**.  
- **Group 2:** Access will be granted in **April**.  

The **GitHub Coordination Team** will contact each individual once a Copilot license has been assigned. Testers will be onboarded in stages to ensure a **smooth transition and efficient support**.  

#### **5. Review & Monitoring (Ongoing – Monthly)**  
To ensure optimal license utilization, a **monthly review** process will be conducted. The **GitHub Copilot Coordinator** will monitor license usage, and any **inactive license (not activated for two consecutive months) will be revoked** and reassigned to testers still waiting for access. This ensures fair distribution of available licenses.
