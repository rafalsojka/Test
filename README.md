Subject: GitHub Copilot Setup – Thank You and Next Steps

Dear All,

I would like to sincerely thank you for your patience and cooperation during the validation of GitHub Copilot on your workstations. I understand that the process was both time-consuming and at times challenging, but thanks to your prompt responses and actions, we successfully configured Copilot for 49 out of 55 eligible users within just two days. We truly appreciate your support in making this possible.

The remaining six users are currently out of office, and we will reach out to them individually once they return. For everyone else, the integration was completed smoothly.

Additionally, we would like to remind you that any issues related to GitHub Copilot—such as timeouts—should be reported to the Copilot coordination email group. If you have experienced any problems over the past two days and haven’t yet reported them, please feel free to reach out to me directly. We are aware that four users have already reported intermittent issues, and we plan to consolidate all such reports and escalate them to our Security team.

What are the next steps?

1. Training
At the beginning of next week, we will share a mandatory training session with you. This training is a requirement from the AI Office and should be completed within one to two weeks.


2. Active Usage and Feedback
We encourage you to actively use GitHub Copilot. Our leadership is keen to hear your feedback, particularly regarding time savings and other benefits in your daily work. A feedback survey will be distributed in June.



If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]
