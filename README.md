Subject: QTest Plugin Upgrade on Jenkins Servers

Dear Test Automation Team,

Please be advised that we have upgraded the qTest plugin on the following Jenkins servers: qclbjenkins and qcjenkins02 as of yesterday.

The new plugin is compatible with the current production version of qTest (2024.4); however, it requires an update to your Jenkins jobs that utilize the plugin. This is due to the introduction of an additional parameter, "App Secret Key," in qTest release 2024.3.

For further details, please refer to the following resources:

Kind regards,
Rafal
