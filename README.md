Welcome to the IT Shared Service Quality Management Test Automation documentation. This page serves as a comprehensive resource for our test automation efforts, focusing on the various frameworks and tools utilized by our team to ensure robust and efficient testing processes.

Our team primarily relies on a mix of Java-based and Python-based testing frameworks. In the Java ecosystem, we utilize tools like TestNG for managing test cases, Maven for project management, JUnit for unit testing, Selenium for automated web application testing, and SoapUI for API testing. Additionally, JMeter is employed for performance testing, while Cucumber aids in behavior-driven development (BDD) through its readable specifications.

On the Python side, we incorporate frameworks such as Pytest for versatile testing, along with other tools like Jenkins for continuous integration and SQL databases for data-driven testing. Our approach ensures that we cover a wide range of testing needs, from functional to performance and API testing.

This documentation aims to provide detailed insights into each framework, guiding team members through best practices, setup instructions, and usage examples. Whether you're a newcomer or an experienced tester, we hope this resource will support your efforts in delivering high-quality software solutions.
