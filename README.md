Subject: GitHub Copilot – Status Update

Hi Bartek,

Following the information shared by Vivian, Hari, and Anthony on Friday regarding the enablement of GitHub Copilot for all eligible testers, here is the current status:

1. We have sent an email to all eligible testers asking them to validate the configuration on their side.


2. I’ve received some initial feedback, but most testers are still in the process of verifying their setup. I expect to have more comprehensive input by the end of the day.


3. One issue that has already surfaced is that GitHub Copilot does not work for everyone when IntelliJ is set to use automatic proxy settings. This requires further investigation. We will need to prepare a list of testers for whom the default proxy configuration prevents successful authentication with GitHub Copilot.


4. Additionally, some users who are able to use Copilot report unstable connections and are receiving the following error: "Request timed out from LSP server."


5. I plan to work with the group today and tomorrow to determine:

How many testers are experiencing connection issues

How many of those with access observe instability

How many are using Copilot without any problems




Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
