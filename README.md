Subject: Mandatory GitHub Copilot Training for Automation Testers

Dear Automation Testers,

As part of BBH’s AI Office initiative on Artificial Intelligence, we are introducing GitHub Copilot for test automation experts in our organization. As you may know, GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered tool that assists software developers in writing code and can significantly enhance test code development productivity.

Your test leaders and managers have selected you as eligible for access to GitHub Copilot. Before granting access, you are required to attend one of the mandatory training sessions to familiarize yourself with the tool and the access process.

Three training sessions have been scheduled at different dates and times. You only need to attend one session—please choose the one that best fits your schedule and workload:

Thursday, March 6 – 10:00 AM CEST | 4:00 AM EST | 2:30 PM IST

Friday, March 7 – 2:00 PM CEST | 8:00 AM EST | 6:30 PM IST

Monday, March 10 – 5:00 PM CEST | 11:00 AM EST | 9:30 PM IST


During the training, we will provide an overview of GitHub Copilot and explain the process for gaining access within BBH.

If you are unable to attend any of these sessions, please contact the GitHub Copilot Coordinator Group to discuss alternative arrangements.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Role]
BBH
