Since this morning, we have been reviewing the issues reported by testers regarding GitHub Copilot. Several scenarios have been identified:

1. Plugin functioning as expected – No action required.


2. Plugin initially unavailable due to proxy misconfiguration in IntelliJ – Resolved by correcting the proxy settings.


3. Plugin unavailable despite correct proxy configuration – A limited number of users experienced this issue earlier today. However, after a few laptop reboots, the plugin is now working correctly.


4. Intermittent timeout issue post-activation – After successfully enabling the plugin, some users are experiencing occasional timeouts. While this does not completely block access to the tool, it causes inconvenience (e.g., requiring repeated proxy authentication or restarting IntelliJ). We are continuing to investigate this issue further.
