Key Updates & Actions:

1. Entitlement Scope: GitHub Copilot entitlements currently apply only to the Quality Management (QM) team for specific coding tasks. Other teams must consult the AI Office for approval.

3. Monitoring & Governance:

GitHub Copilot usage will be reviewed monthly.

A formal process for handling new joiners and leavers must be established.

Criteria for maintaining or revoking entitlements need to be clarified.

Distinctions between Full-Time Employees (FTEs) and consultants in the process must be defined.



4. Review & Access Control:

More details will be added regarding entitlement reviews and monitoring.

Entitlement changes will occur on a quarterly basis.

A Confluence page will be created to document the review and monitoring process.

A process for revisiting the scope of usage needs to be established.



5. Awareness & Compliance:

Awareness training and formal attestation must be conducted annually.

The responsible owner for managing this process needs to be designated.



6. Ownership & Usage Boundaries:

QM is the owner of GitHub Copilot usage, as approved by the AI Office.

Usage is strictly limited to test data and test code—deployment to production is not permitted.

The entitlement process must clarify roles between system and business owners.
