To measure the increase in software test automation in your Quality Management department, you need an automated tool that can track key metrics over time. Since your company already has a system that stores quality management metrics, you may be able to enhance it to measure automation growth. Here’s how you can approach it:

Key Metrics to Track

1. Automated Test Coverage (%) – Ratio of automated test cases to total test cases.


2. Number of Automated Test Cases – Absolute count of automated tests over time.


3. Automated vs. Manual Test Ratio – Comparison of automated tests to manual ones.


4. Execution Frequency of Automated Tests – How often automated tests are run.


5. Defect Detection Efficiency – Number of defects found by automation vs. manual testing.


6. Test Execution Time – Time saved through automation vs. manual execution.



Automation Approaches

1. Leverage Existing Test Management Tools

If you already use JIRA, Xray, TestRail, Zephyr, or a similar tool, check if they provide APIs or built-in reports to track automation growth.



2. Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines

If tests run in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI, extract data from logs or build artifacts to track execution frequency.



3. Use a Dashboard (Grafana, Power BI, or Kibana)

Create a visualization of automation trends by integrating with your existing metrics system.



4. Custom Metrics Extraction from Version Control (GitHub, Bitbucket)

Count the number of test scripts added in a specific repo over time.

Use Git hooks or scripts to extract trends.



5. Automate Reporting

Create a scheduled script that queries test management databases and automatically generates reports.




Would your team be able to extend your current quality metrics system, or do you need an entirely new tool for this?
