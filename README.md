Hi \[Boss’s Name],

I looked into this — the GitHub Copilot API does not provide any information about which repositories were modified using Copilot-generated code. Copilot suggestions are treated the same as manually written code once accepted, and there’s no metadata linking them back to Copilot.

At the enterprise level, GitHub only offers usage reporting (e.g., how often Copilot is used and by which users/teams), but not repository-level tracking. If we need more detailed governance, we’d have to handle it through internal policies or additional tooling.

Best regards,
