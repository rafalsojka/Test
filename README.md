GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that integrates seamlessly into development environments to provide real-time code suggestions. Understanding its data flow is crucial for assessing its impact on security and compliance, especially in sensitive industries like banking.

**Overview of GitHub Copilot's Data Flow:**

1. **Context Collection:** As you write code, Copilot gathers context from your current file, related files, and any comments or functions you've written.

2. **Prompt Construction:** This context is used to build a prompt that represents the coding task or query.

3. **Data Transmission:** The prompt is securely transmitted to GitHub's cloud-based servers hosted on Microsoft Azure.

4. **AI Processing:** The prompt is processed by OpenAI's Codex model, which generates code suggestions based on the provided context.

5. **Response Delivery:** The generated code suggestions are sent back to your development environment, where you can review and incorporate them as needed.
