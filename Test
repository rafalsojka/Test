Certainly, here's a more professionally phrased version:

Mike, it is essential to specify whether a defect was identified during manual or automated testing. Additionally, it's important to distinguish if the defect was discovered during regression testing or while testing new functionality. This is why default values are not provided for these fields; it is crucial for the tester to accurately understand and report the context of the defect.

I hope this clarifies the matter.
