Certainly, here's a more professionally phrased version:

Mike, it is essential to specify whether a defect was identified during manual or automated testing. Additionally, it's important to distinguish if the defect was discovered during regression testing or while testing new functionality. This is why default values are not provided for these fields; it is crucial for the tester to accurately understand and report the context of the defect.

I hope this clarifies the matter.

Certainly, here's the revised version with the additional paragraph:

Mike, it is essential to specify whether a defect was identified during manual or automated testing. Additionally, it's important to distinguish if the defect was discovered during regression testing or while testing new functionality. This is why default values are not provided for these fields; it is crucial for the tester to accurately understand and report the context of the defect.

This requirement is not only necessary for generating accurate monthly Quality Management (QM) reports but also primarily to enhance the traceability of defects and ensure adherence to Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles. Proper classification and documentation of defects facilitate better analysis, tracking, and resolution, ultimately leading to improved software quality.

I hope this clarifies the matter.

**Performance Testing:**

- Successfully completed 20 performance test projects for various applications, ensuring high quality and meeting both development and QA requirements.

**Major Achievements:** Implementation of the STAR automation framework on JMeter and Jenkins.

**Test Automation:**

- Conducted two proof-of-concept projects for GitHub Copilot across two phases, collaborating with a larger quality management team comprising four senior test automation experts.
- Designed, implemented, and deployed a quality management KPI metric tool to automatically monitor test team performance, eliminating the need for manual monthly reports from test leaders.

**Tools Management:**

- Upgraded various tools used by testers, including qTest, Jira, NeoLoad, TestComplete, among others.
- Handled hundreds of user support tickets to provision access, resolve issues, configure projects, and develop various customizations for qTest Manager, Jira, TestComplete, and NeoLoad.
